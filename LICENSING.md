# Licensing

## Compás

Compás is free software: GNU General Public License, version 3 only
(`GPL-3.0-only`). The full text is in `LICENSE`. There is no warranty.

Compás is a Felucca-family firmware. It builds on the pinned Felucca board
support (register definitions, IRQ entry, LCD driver and link script), which is
itself GPL-3.0-only; `board/BSP.json` pins each of those files and the licence
by SHA-256. The upstream Felucca revision is
`ef1f561b6b105f20350f6b1eac0dc0789a357f00`. Felucca-derived files keep their
GPL-3.0-only identifiers and the copyright notices of Leo Kuroshita and
Hügelton Instruments.

The USB MIDI driver, the M-UPGRADE updater and the browser installer modules
come from BB1 BAND r85, source commit
`1df20dcf9feda197a6bd668cf24f97d99d4f8ae1`, under the same licence. Their
original copyright notices remain in the source. `docs/USB-UPDATER-REVIEW.md`
records the exact archive and build inputs.

## The 727 sound bank

The TR-727 percussion recordings in the sound bank are owned by the Compás
author and are included under the same terms as the rest of Compás.
`board/727-sources.json` lists the fifteen recordings.

## Kumbia Kit

The four sounds and four factory patterns are from [Hanan Cumbia by Oficina
de Sonido](https://www.oficinadesonido.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/07/Hanan-Cumbia.pdf)
(build `hanan26Taller`, 2026-07-21), based on Bleep Labs' Bleep Drum. The
unmodified sample and pattern data retain their
[CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) licence.
Compás applies the knob settings during playback.

## Stage art and the tribute

The Picnic and Rodeo splash marks (`docs/STAGE-DESIGN.md`) and the Johnny
Canales portrait with its supplied photograph (`docs/JOHNNY-CANALES.md`) are
cleared for public release with Compás. Their provenance is recorded in those
documents.

## Written-song arrangements

Most written songs are arranged from printed editions in the U.S. public
domain; the sources are recorded in `docs/REPERTOIRE.md` and `repertoire/`.
Three come from openly licensed editions. Their score data and MIDI keep the
original licence, and the original authors are credited here:
